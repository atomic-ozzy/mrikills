      <h1>MRI MACHINES style="colour:Tomato;">KILL</h1>
      <p>MRI machines have killed <b>MANY</b> people in the past and they can be very dangerous because they suck magnetic objects into them if they are too strong.</p>
      <h2>How do MRI machine magnets work?</h2>
      <p>MRI machines use powerful magnets that make a strong magenetic field that forces protons in the body to align with the machine's.</p>
      <p><del>html5</del> <b>be</b> <i>like</i><br>MRI machines are much more detailed than CT scans and X-Rays because they use magenetic fields to generate an extremley detailed image of the body. <b>Magnetic resonance imaging</b> is used in radiology. It uses magnetic gradients and radio waves to generate images of organs in the body.</p>
      <h3>*A Note<h3>
      <p>Although they are extremley useful, seeing how detailed they are, they are ludacrously and badonkulously expensive in a crazytronic kind of mad way!</p>
      <h4>THE FLIPPING END</h4>
